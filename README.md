Maximum-Item-Quality-ItemSet
============================

MIQ Tree in Data Mining for Association rules Mining  to get High Utility Set

Step 1- Import the project Directly into Eclipse

Step 2-Run only main.java file and pass two parameter in it by going into Run Configuration 
A)	Database.txt (Text file for Transaction Database)
B)	Profit.txt (Text file for Profit of each item)

Step 3-Then Run main.java file as java application 

I have implemenetd one of the Resaerch Paper that was shared in my repository named as "High Utility Itemset Mining MIQ".
Where we have transaction database and each item profit considering all these we have to prune such candidates 
which are not useful for final candidated according to the structure defined in the PDF so considering 3 terms

1)Estimated maximum global item utility

2)Estimated maximum item utility of an item ip

3)Estimated maximum candidate itemset utility

At last we will get most frequnet itemset with Pruning Candidates.


I hope you will get all the things here and will help you alot.
